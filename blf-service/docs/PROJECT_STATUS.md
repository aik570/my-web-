# Project Status — BLF Service redesign

Last update: 2026-10-26 · **Stage 01 complete.** Waiting for approval
before Stage 02. One human decision is open: gallery sign-off (A4 in
MISSING_INFORMATION).

## Stage 01 — Discovery, asset extraction, foundation

### Done

**Discovery**
- [x] Saved the supplied gallery HTML unmodified
      (`references/source-html/galerie.html`, SHA-256 `20649488…895b5`).
      It is byte-identical to the live page on 2026-10-26.
- [x] Parsed it with a script: 27 asset files, 0 duplicates, 62 `srcset`
      derivatives excluded; 9 gallery categories with image mapping, alt
      texts, widths and inferred upload dates.

**Tooling and audit**
- [x] Wrote and audited `scripts/fetch-originals.sh`. It is read-only,
      requests manifest URLs only over https, follows no redirects, never
      overwrites existing files or links, rejects non-image or empty
      responses, and logs the reason for every failure. It was tested
      against success, non-image, 404, cross-host 301, blocked host,
      existing file, dangling link and second-run cases.
- [x] Cross-checked the manifest (JSON and TSV), log and inventory tables
      field by field against the HTML.

**Retrieval** (after the network allowance)
- [x] **28 / 28 assets retrieved and verified.** That is the original 27
      plus `telefon.png` (ICO-08), found during the page audit.
      - All responses were HTTP 200 from the manifest URL, with no
        redirects.
      - Each file fully decoded; format matches Content-Type; SHA-256 and
        size recomputed; widths match the HTML.
      - No duplicate content, no EXIF/GPS in photos, SVG free of scripts.
      - The second run left all existing files untouched.
      - Records: `download-log-run1.tsv`, `download-log.tsv`,
        `asset-verification.tsv`.

**Pages and content**
- [x] Saved the other six pages unmodified in
      `references/source-html/pages-2026-10-26/` (all HTTP 200, no
      redirects; `page-fetch-log.tsv`), and the live stylesheet in
      `references/source-css/`.
- [x] Wrote the full content audit. It separates verified facts, site
      claims (quoted, not verified) and our own inferences, and lists issues
      found on the live site:
      - USt-IdNr. format in the Impressum;
      - undisclosed analytics;
      - broken contact-form recipient;
      - no job listings.

**Gallery and docs**
- [x] Visually reviewed all 19 gallery photos. 18 visibly match their tab,
      and GAL-16 is plausible. The upload filenames are the misleading
      signal, not the tabs. **No files moved**; that waits for sign-off.
- [x] Updated ASSET_INVENTORY, CONTENT_AUDIT, MISSING_INFORMATION (with 14
      German client questions) and this file.

### Remaining failures / open items

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Asset retrieval | none failed |
| Page retrieval | none failed |
| 11 gallery files still in `_unclassified/` | Waiting for human sign-off on the proposed classification. One command once approved |
| Camera originals, vector logo, job content, Ma'Loa reference | Must come from the client or project owner. Not obtainable from the site |
| Contact form | Not submitted on purpose (it would send a real message to the client); delivery problem inferred from the HTML only |

### Not done on purpose

- No design, no frontend code, no dependencies added.
- `public/assets/optimized/` stays empty until the design defines sizes.
- Two CSS-referenced images were not retrieved: one is an Adobe Stock
  photo, both are unused template leftovers.
- Nothing was sent to or changed on the live site; only GET requests.
- The A135 landing page and all files outside `blf-service/` are unchanged.

## Before Stage 02

1. Decide A4: approve moving the 11 gallery files into their tabs' folders.
2. Send the German client questions (`MISSING_INFORMATION.md`).
3. Supply the Ma'Loa reference material.
4. Give explicit approval to start Stage 02.
